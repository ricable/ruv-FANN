Product Requirements Document (PRD): Unified AI-Powered RAN Intelligence & Automation Platform
Version: 2.0 (Swarm Implementation Blueprint)
Objective: This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the creation of a RAN Intelligence platform. It is designed to be parsed and executed by a swarm of autonomous coding agents. The project is divided into foundational services and feature-focused epics, which are further broken down into independent modules and atomic agent tasks.
Core Technology Stack:
ML Engine: ruv-FANN (Rust-based Fast Artificial Neural Network library)
Primary Backend Language: Rust (for performance-critical services, ML core)
Data Plumbing & Prototyping: Python (for data ingestion scripts, exploratory analysis)
Data Interchange Format: Apache Parquet
Inter-Service Communication: gRPC
Epic 0: Platform Foundation Services (PFS)
Objective: To build the core infrastructure required for all other platform features. These tasks are prerequisites and should be prioritized.
